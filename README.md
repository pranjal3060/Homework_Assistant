## Why?

Studying is hard. Homework Helper makes learning material easier! 

Just copy and paste your notes into our website, click submit, and you have an interactive quiz to help you learn!


Our product attempts to help students prepare for exams by automatically generating short quizzes from their notes.  This is a useful tool because practice exams are a tried and true indicator as to whether students have retained the information they have been studying, but many professors still don’t post exams from prior semesters.  The backend of the application makes use of the Python Natural Language Toolkit package as well as Jake Shulman’s open source code from his NLP workshop, to find the most important sentences in the input document, and consequently the most important word in each sentence.  It then generates a fill-in-the-blank quiz to be displayed on a web app using a Flask server.  Next steps include several optimizations like favoring certain parts of speech and different classes of words.
